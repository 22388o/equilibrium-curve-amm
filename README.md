# Project description

Substrate-based runtime version of Curve automated market maker will be a 7 week long project which will deliver a following functionality:

- Low slippage, high efficiency stablecoin exchange

- High efficiency exchange tool for other homogeneous assets on Polkadot (e.g. wrapped assets) 

- Low risk fee income for liquidity providers. 

- Liquidity superfluidity with additional rewards from supplying liquidity to lending protocols such as Equilibrium and Acala.

Curve AMM is of paramount importance to the entire Polkadot ecosystem. With the introduction of parachains and interconnection of different Polka-based projects the issue of multiple wrapped assets representing the same underlying assets arises.

Consider ETH, for example. There are multiple bridging solutions who promise to introduce wrapped-ETH and other ERC-20 tokens to Polkadot. There needs to be a way to manage or exchange all of these representations of the same underlying asset inside Polkadot with low cost and low slippage, and that is where the Curve AMM comes into play.

Curveâ€™s unique stableswap invariant utilizes liquidity much more efficiently compared to all existing DEXes for stablecoins at already several hundred USD TVL (total value locked). Since initial liquidity on Polkadot is hardly going to be very large, proposed efficiency is VERY important for the ecosystem to flourish.
